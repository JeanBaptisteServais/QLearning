Egreedy, Knn, Qlearning

Dk learn to find an exit with maximum reward. With a exploiration phase and an exploitation phase in function of an e greedy technic. He learns to avoid missile with Knn technic


<h1>Training phase</h1>


<h1>Environement 1 exit</h1>


<h1>Environement 2 exits (reward / no reward)</h1>


<h1>Environement 2 exits (reward / no reward) with deadlock and avoid missile</h1>





nb: he go top/bot because missile takes 5 iterations for moving !!


Egreedy: exploration 100% 5000 first iteration, down each 2000 iteration after to 0% (down it of 10%) <br>
Knn: dk have detector of missile, he can goes down or don't move in function of missile coords (generated by data simulate)<br>
for the deadlock: if he takes a "G" item he recup the min movement and at the last coord, he recup the second best movement...
