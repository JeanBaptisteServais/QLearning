# QLearning
Egreedy, Knn, Qlearning

Dk learn to find an exit with maximum reward. <br>
With a exploiration phase and an exploitation phase in function of an e greedy technic. <br>
He learns to avoid missile with Knn technic

<br><br><br>

<h2>Training phase</h2>

red reward : -1 <br>
green reward: +500 <br>
yellow reward: + 100 <br>
out reward green: + 20000<br>
missile luncher: -100




<h2>Environement 1 exit</h2>

<h2>Environement 2 exits (reward / no reward)</h2>

<h2>Environement 2 exits (reward / no reward) with deadlock and avoid missile</h2>

nb: he go top/bot because missile takes 5 iterations for moving !! And he doesn't go to the green because wasn't finish (oups)


Egreedy: exploration 100% 5000 first iteration, down each 2000 iteration after to 0% (down it of 10%) <br>
Knn: dk have detector of missile, he can goes down or don't move in function of missile coords (generated by data simulate)<br>
for the deadlock: if he takes a "G" item he recup the min movement and at the last coord, he recup the second best movement...
